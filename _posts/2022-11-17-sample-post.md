Hi, my name is Ega. As a continue my journey as a master's student, I spend my leisure time reviewing my portfolio and tidying it up into a structured personal webpage. To begin with, I started with research, and I found out that most professionals write their own blog posts on their personal websites or Blogspot. I wonder what's the point of writing blog posts on a personal webpage. And voila, I thought it would be a good idea if I give it a try to answer my very own question. At least, there are five reasons why I started to write one, which are:
<!--more-->

1. I want to improve my writing skills, and I want to be able to write in a more structured way.

2. I want to use this website as a personal portfolio.

3. I want to have an overview of my work and achievements to date, as well as where Iâ€™m going in the future (e.g., research interests).

4. I want to share the knowledge that I learn in the master's program with the world so it could the ideas that I learn could reach other students who have no chance to apply for a master's degree.

5. Finally, it will be nice for others (potential employers) or students at universities or other institutions to see what kind of person I am and what kind of work I do!

This is a trial post. I will update it later with more serious and fruitful contents.

Best,

Ega Kurnia Yazid
