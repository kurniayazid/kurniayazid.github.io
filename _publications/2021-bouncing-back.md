abstract: 'Indonesia experiences a high frequency of disasters over the years which resulted in a devastating
effect on both national and regional economies. Using the city-level data which consists of 497
cities/regencies from 2011 to 2018 which retrieved from the disaster information database (DIBI) by
the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) and regional data information system (SIMREG) by the
National Planning Agency (Bappenas), the study aims to investigate the effect of the disaster on the
regional economic growth per capita. Incorporating the Least Square Dummy Variable â€“ Corrected
(LSDVC) model, we explored the effect with different disaster types, economic sectors, recovery time,
and we also interacted the disaster with the contingency budget to see how it helped the economy to
revive from disasters. The study found that each disaster has a different effect on the economic sectors
despite the general effect of a disaster shows a negative impact on the regional economy per capita by
0.008 percentage point for one in a thousand houses affected by a disaster or 0.014 percentage point
for one in a thousand people affected by a disaster. The primary sector becomes the most prone to the
disaster impact due to its labor-intensive characteristic. Furthermore, averagely, cities and regencies in
Indonesia can rebound within a year from the impact of the disaster, while the volcanic and geologic
disasters even showed a creative destruction process indicated by the positive effect on the economy
a year after the disaster occurred. Besides, the contingency budget, on average, was inadequate for the
economic recovery when the disaster occurred. This study suggests that the disaster mitigation should
be more focused on the labor-intensive sector to improve its resilience against disaster, while the
reinvestment in the recovery time could be more focused on the capital-intensive sector to optimize
the creative destruction process and to offset the negative impact from the primary sector. The study
also found that the model tends to robust in different estimation models.'
