abstract: "Indonesia's commitment to reducing poverty is quite hindered due to the lack of data
quality which makes various social assistances often not targeted. Therefore, this study
aims to determine the error pattern in social assistance, especially inclusion error, and
its impact on opportunity loss. Using Susenas survey data, descriptive statistics, and
multinominal logit methods, this study finds that both inclusion and exclusion errors
existed and were distributed in each economic percentile for both programs. The
estimation also shows that the inclusion error in the PKH program and BPNT are
34.85% and 39.21%, respectively. In addition, the determinants of errors consisting of
household characteristics and regional context are discussed. We also suggest the policy
recommendations based on the results. \\
