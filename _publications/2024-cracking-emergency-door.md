abstract: "This study empirically investigates the impact of economic openness on the inflow
of International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) to countries experiencing crises.
While previous research on economic openness and general foreign aid has yielded inconclusive
results, there is a gap in understanding its specific relationship with IHA.
This research is motivated by the increasing number of people affected by crises and
the rising amount of IHA. The study addresses two key questions, firstly, the effect
of a country’s economic openness on the received IHA, and secondly, how regional,
income level, and political system variations influence this relationship. It posits that
economic openness can create a more favorable environment for international aid by
fostering economic growth and stability. The research employs panel data and uses
the IHA/GDP ratio as the dependent variable, with economic openness calculated as
the sum of a country’s exports and imports divided by its GDP. Findings indicate a
statistically positive effect of economic openness on IHA inflow, particularly in poorer
countries. The study also suggests that a country’s global export share positively affects
IHA inflow, supporting the dependency theory argument that donor countries
incentivize economies contributing to the global supply chain. Conversely, political
conditionality and altruistic motives do not appear to significantly influence IHA allocation.
The research suggests that IHA may complement other forms of economic
assistance, such as Official Development Assistance (ODA). Policy implications include
recommending increased economic openness in crisis-affected countries, prioritizing aid
to poorer nations, and fostering stronger economic ties with countries involved in global
trade networks. \\
